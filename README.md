# hello-world

Heya Fellow Codemonkeys!

I'm not very original in my handle so it's just my initials, I know, super basic.

I'm an IT pro working as a consultant, but spending way too much time in meetings and sending emails and not spending enough time actually working with tech. Time to swerve and get my hands dirty again. So I'm here to lounge around GitHub and get my tentacles into some code again. I've been feelin' rusty and am so thirsty to get back in the game and just low key code for the fun of it again. Maybe even build up my side hustle a little, doing some web dev or small app dev. Who'm I kidding? Coding by the beach is total goals :-D
